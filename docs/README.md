## Getting Started

To use this character sheet in your Roll20 D&D 5e game, search for **D&D 5e (Darker Dungeons)** in the roll20 sheet list.

## Code Contributions

This project contains source code and build scripts to generate both development and live sheet code. If you'd like to try out some code changes and contributions—or customise the sheet for your own bespoke game—read the following:

### Requirements

1. Node.js (https://nodejs.org/en/).
2. gulp-cli (https://gulpjs.com/docs/en/getting-started/quick-start/)

### Instructions

1. Run "npm install" to install all the required node_modules.
2. Run "gulp" to build the dev/live sheets from source and automatically watch for any file changes.
3. To test locally: open _dist/dev/darker-dungeons.html_.
4. To upload to Roll20: copy _dist/live/darker-dungeon.css_ and _dist/live/darker-dungeon.html_ to Roll20.
